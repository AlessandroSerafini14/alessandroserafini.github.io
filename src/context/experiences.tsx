            At the age of 20, I was entrusted with the development of the web
            portal of the Consortium of Viale Ceccarini: the famous avenue of
            Riccione which is dedicated to shopping, nightlife and
            entertainment.
          </p>
          <p>
            The main goal of this portal was to better present the shopping
            facilities that &quot;follow&quot; the walk and to promote events
            and shows held by the Consortium itself and by the City of Riccione.
