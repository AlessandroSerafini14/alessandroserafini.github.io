          <h2>TL;DR</h2>

          <p>
            I am a Front End developer with industry experience building web
            applications. I specialize in React, Typescript and Javascript and

          <p>
            My role is to build and style the front-end components that meet the
            requirements of given mocks and fulfill the user stories. I also
            monitor, process and validate pull requests before production
            deployments.
          </p>

          <p>
            My specialties include quickly learning new skills and programming
            languages, problem solving, responsive design principles and

          <h2>A little bit of context</h2>
          <p>
            Hey there! I am Alessandro Serafini. I was born in Rimini üèñÔ∏è, Italy
            üáÆüáπ on 07/09/1992.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ever since I was a child, I have always been passionate about
            technology, in particular computers and what is possible to create.
          </p>

          <p>
            This led me to choose computer science as early as high school,
            where I was fascinated by the history and evolution of technology:
            from the &quot;Colossus&quot; to the present day and how these
            machines could be programmed.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once I graduated, I chose to work as a freelancer to gain as much
            experience as possible for different companies.
          </p>

          <p>
            After two years, one of these experiences led me to Mr. APPs, an app
            agency in San Marino where I decided to stay full-time and grow as a
            web and mobile developer (React Native).
          </p>

          <p>
            During this experience, my curiosity to learn and desire to grow
            pushed me to enrol at the University of Urbino Carlo Bo, Department
            of Pure and Applied Sciences studying in the evenings after work.
            After just three years, I obtained my degree with a mark of 100/110.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, a few months before obtaining my degree, I decided to dive
            into the world of artificial intelligence: this led me to change
            companies again, always staying in San Marino: here I met Botika.
          </p>

          <p>
            After a year and a half, I again felt that urge to grow both
            personally and professionally, the desire to get to know new and
            different languages and cultures. So I decided to move to Paris
            (FR), where I started a wonderful adventure with Veepee.
